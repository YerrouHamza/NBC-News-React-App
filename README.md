# React News Website

This project is a React News Website, built according to a Figma design. It utilizes the **Newsapi.org** to fetch news data.

Please note that **Newsapi.org** is free only in the development environment, which restricts us from making this website live. 

To provide a comprehensive overview of the website's functionality, a Loom video demonstration has been created.
